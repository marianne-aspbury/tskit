[0.2.1] - 2019-08-23
--------------------

Major feature release, adding support for population genetic statistics,
improved VCF output and many other features.

**Note:** Version 0.2.0 was skipped because of an error uploading to PyPI
which could not be undone.

**Breaking changes**

- Genotype arrays returned by ``TreeSequence.variants`` and
  ``TreeSequence.genotype_matrix`` have changed from unsigned 8 bit values
  to signed 8 bit values to accomodate missing data (see :issue:`144` for
  discussion). Specifically, the dtype of the genotypes arrays have changed
  from numpy "u8" to "i8". This should not affect client code in any way
  unless it specifically depends on the type of the returned numpy array.

- The VCF written by the ``write_vcf`` is no longer compatible with previous
  versions, which had significant shortcomings. Position values are now rounded
  to the nearest integer by default, REF and ALT values are derived from the
  actual allelic states (rather than always being A and T). Sample names
  are now of the form ``tsk_j`` for sample ID j. Most of the legacy behaviour
  can be recovered with new options, however.

- The positional parameter ``reference_sets`` in ``genealogical_nearest_neighbours``
  and ``mean_descendants`` TreeSequence methods has been renamed to
  ``sample_sets``.

**New features**

- Support for general windowed statistics. Implementations of diversity,
  divergence, segregating sites, Tajima's D, Fst, Patterson's F statistics,
  Y statistics, trait correlations and covariance, and k-dimensional allele
  frequency specra (:user:`petrelharp`, :user:`jeromekelleher`, :user:`molpopgen`).

- Add the ``keep_unary`` option to simplify (:user:`gtsambos`). See :issue:`1`
  and :pr:`143`.

- Add the ``map_ancestors`` method to TableCollection (user:`gtsambos`). See :pr:`175`.

- Add the ``squash`` method to EdgeTable (:user:`gtsambos`). See :issue:`59` and
  :pr:`285`.

- Add support for individuals to VCF output, and fix major issues with output
  format (:user:`jeromekelleher`). Position values are transformed in a much
  more straightforward manner and output has been generalised substantially.
  Adds ``individual_names`` and ``position_transform`` arguments.
  See :pr:`286`, and issues :issue:`2`, :issue:`30` and :issue:`73`.

- Control height scale in SVG trees using 'tree_height_scale' and 'max_tree_height'
  (:user:`hyanwong`, :user:`jeromekelleher`). See :issue:`167`, :pr:`168`.
  Various other improvements to tree drawing (:pr:`235`, :pr:`241`, :pr:`242`,
  :pr:`252`, :pr:`259`).

- Add ``Tree.max_root_time`` property (:user:`hyanwong`, :user:`jeromekelleher`).
  See :pr:`170`.

- Improved input checking on various methods taking numpy arrays as parameters
  (:user:`hyanwong`). See :issue:`8` and :pr:`185`.

- Define the branch length over roots in trees to be zero (previously raise
  an error; :user:`jeromekelleher`). See :issue:`188` and :pr:`191`.

- Implementation of the genealogical nearest neighbours statistic
  (:user:`hyanwong`, :user:`jeromekelleher`).

- New ``delete_intervals`` and ``keep_intervals`` method for the TableCollection
  to allow slicing out of topology from specific intervals (:user:`hyanwong`,
  :user:`andrewkern`, :user:`petrelharp`, :user:`jeromekelleher`). See
  :pr:`225` and :pr:`261`.

- Support for missing data via a topological definition (:user:`jeromekelleher`).
  See :issue:`270` and :pr:`272`.

- Add ability to set columns directly in the Tables API (:user:`jeromekelleher`).
  See :issue:`12` and :pr:`307`.

- Various documentation improvements from :user:`brianzhang`, :user:`hyanwong`,
  :user:`petrelharp` and :user:`jeromekelleher`.

**Deprecated**

- Deprecate ``Tree.length`` in favour of ``Tree.span`` (:user:`hyanwong`).
  See :pr:`169`.

- Deprecate ``TreeSequence.pairwise_diversity`` in favour of the new
  ``diversity`` method. See :issue:`215`, :pr:`312`.

**Bugfixes**

- Catch NaN and infinity values within tables (:user:`hyanwong`).
  See :issue:`293` and :pr:`294`.

--------------------
[0.1.5] - 2019-03-27
--------------------

This release removes support for Python 2, adds more flexible tree access and a
new ``tskit`` command line interface.

**New features**

- Remove support for Python 2 (:user:`hugovk`). See :issue:`137` and :pr:`140`.
- More flexible tree API (:pr:`121`). Adds ``TreeSequence.at`` and
  ``TreeSequence.at_index`` methods to find specific trees, and efficient support
  for backwards traversal using ``reversed(ts.trees())``.
- Add initial ``tskit`` CLI (:issue:`80`)
- Add ``tskit info`` CLI command (:issue:`66`)
- Enable drawing SVG trees with coloured edges (:user:`hyanwong`; :issue:`149`).
- Add ``Tree.is_descendant`` method (:issue:`120`)
- Add ``Tree.copy`` method (:issue:`122`)

**Bugfixes**

- Fixes to the low-level C API (:issue:`132` and :issue:`157`)

files and processes them should be able to work without changes.

**Breaking changes**

- Removal of the previously deprecated ``sort_tables``, ``simplify_tables``
  and ``load_tables`` functions. All code should change to using corresponding
  TableCollection methods.

- Rename ``SparseTree`` class to ``Tree``.
